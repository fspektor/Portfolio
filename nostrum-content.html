            <div id="project-tag">Nostrum: Creating Your Better Self</div>
            <div id="project-graph">Working at the intersection of
                    art and social practice, we create and run a fictional wellness company to critique Bay Area optimization culture.

                <p>Nostrum is a speculative provocation and performance piece, designed and built by myself,
                Justine Chia, Heidi Dong, Hailey Windsor, and Annalise Kamegawa. Our project was featured by the <a href="https://citris-uc.org/all-woman-team-constructs-clever-commentary-in-citris-invention-lab/">
                    CITRIS and the Bantatao Institute</a> both for its success as a concept and as an example of interdisciplinary collaboration.
                    It is currently on display at the CITRIS Tech Museum.</p>

                        and body. We aim to help you be the best version of yourself — healthier, more productive, and more efficient.

                    <p>We designed Nostrum to give our customers an immersive experience.
                        Upon visiting our Wellness Center, you are guided by our technicians
                        to take an initial assessment from our <a href="https://heidid.github.io/nostrum/index.html">website</a>.</p>

                        <p>After inputting a few personal details, insert your hand into the Wellness Pod.
                            From here, our proprietary algorithms compute your biometric data — and voila! A customized pill emerges.</p>

                    <P>This satirical company serves as a critique of
                            Bay Area optimization culture, disregard for data privacy, and the desire for instantaneous solutions.
                            With Nostrum, we intended to produce a truly absurd experience to mirror the troubling advertising we were seeing.</P>

                        Not truly a biometric scanning device, the Wellness Pod is actuated through a photocell and servo motor,
                        which triggers a hopper of pills. 
                        
                        <p>As the project developed, I worked on the physical prototyping of the piece, as well as on researching our
                                rhetoric and creating the visual brand assets.</p>

                <div id="listing-copy">The inspiration for this project came directly from a survey of
                    similar products on the market. Almost all of our copy comes directly from these existing products.

                    <p>We noticed a disturbing trend for false or unverifiable
                    claims for wellness or productivity supplements, such as "unmatched glow" and "73% more sunshine in your step."</p>

                    Even more troubling, however, was the focus on human optimization, often a
                    push to work longer hours under the guise of enhancement.

                    As we ran the performance over several days, we were surprised to discover how many individuals mentioned to us that Nostrum <i>did in fact</i>
                    make them feel better. Even when folks new it was a fictional product, the placebo effect remains powerful.

                   <p> Many also told us they used the real supplement products mentioned above, and felt "called out."
                       Nosturm's product advertising was both an accurate portrayal of the drive for enhancement,
                       but also of some individuals' spending habits.
                       In this way, the piece succeeded in it's provocation. We would be interested to continue testing this
                       fictional product in a less theatrical manner, to see how individuals respond to our claims.
