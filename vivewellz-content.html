            <div id="project-graph">
                We created a set of speculative designs exploring the future of period-tracking technologies — and the expansive surveillance practices therein.
                <p>The designs feature in a winter product catalog for fictional company Vivewell.
                        We also contribute a pictorial documenting this process.</p>
                This project is a collaboration with Sarah Fox, Noura Howell, and Richmond Wong.

                <div id="listing-copy">It is an increasingly common practice for people who menstruate to record their intimate data.
                 New biosensing technologies and period tracking apps make this easier than ever,
                 collecting information on users' sex life, pregnancy status, miscarriages, and top-searched medical questions.
            
                 <p>In April of 2019, reporting from The Washington Post revealed that period tracking application
                      Ovia was quietly marketing their users’ data to employers and health insurance companies.
                      Though this disturbing reporting comes several months after we sumbitted our own work,
                      it brings to light the very issues we consider.

                        existing data policies for the top 50 period tracking apps on the Apple and Google Play stores.
                        We explored how these policies compound existing concerns for the everyday ethics of extracting
                        and analyzing intimate data. Our findings inform the design of the speculative near future
                        technologies in the catalog. </p>

                        <p>Ovia, for instance, stipulates a “royalty-free, perpetual, and irrevocable license, throughout the universe"
                            to user data. So, if the nation state crumbles or we go to Mars, Ovia can still sell your data.

                    fashion marketing techniques of the 40’s. By developing this illustrative style for near-future products,
                    we interrogate whether our biases really changed -- especially with feminine stereotypes.
                    With this in mind, I worked on a new visual language to meld vintage advertising aesthetics with digital interfaces.

                    <p>As part of the catalog, we introduce the Lithe Collection, which includes a sportswear and lingerie line for women.
                        We emulated the hype of self-tracking products that emphasize optimization through data-driven insights.
                        “Objective” metrics guide fitness routines, and contribute to partner surveillance in intimate relationships.

                    With Privvy, we move beyond personal tracking to explore the ethics of workplace monitoring.
                    How do employees respond when a corporate push for efficiency becomes intertwined with aspirations toward improved personal wellness?

                    <p>Privvy is a smart toilet: energy is harvested from employee fecal matter, and menses is collected to fertilize the office plants.
                        It can keep track of how long you were in the bathroom, and what your bio levels are.
                        Our Manager Suite view allows employers to track individuals by these metrics and make interventions when necessary.</p>
                    
                    <p>
                            Knowing employer-provided insurance programs are already linked to tracking devices,
                            we use speculative futuring to elucidate the hidden risks of intimate surveillance.
                            By using these design fictions to explore how technology reinforces existing threats,
                            we hope to fight against exploitative policy.
