            <div id="project-tag">Gena: Inclusive Sex-Ed Toolkit</div>
            <div id="project-graph">Gena is an open source sex-ed toolkit for the blind & visually impaired.
                We are creating these inclusive anatomical models for use in low-resourced sex education settings.
                        <p>
                        The call for this project was originally brought to us by Laura Millar,
                        a blind sex education leader and prolific Bay Area community organizer.
                        We've since continued the work with the Tecnológico de Monterrey, and recieved support from
                        the Jacobs Institute for Design Innovation. This is an ongoing work in progress,
                        developed in collaboration with Annalise Kamegawa and Hailey Windsor.</p></div>

                        internal and external anatomy by peeling back layers of differing textures.

                            To this end, we want the processes of fabrication
                            to be simple and understandable; anyone should be able to recreate a version of this model with
                            the resources they have on hand.</p>

                            By splitting the toolkit into 1) the model base, 2) tactile components,
                            and 3) electronic components, we consider what the model may look like in a variety of contexts.
                            In order to optimize our project’s accessibility,
                              we are designing a website that will host files for each of these layers.
         
                            <p>Using our carefully designed templates, we hope a low fidelity version made with a cardboard base and
                                paper mache tactile components will prove as useful a high fidelity version made with
                                molded silicone and electronics.</p>
